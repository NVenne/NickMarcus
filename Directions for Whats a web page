Whats a web page with Kudela
Directions 

3.  Download and unzip the 
2.1.1 sourceFiles.zip
. This zip file contains a file

sample.html
 shown below. Note the location where you have saved it.

4. Open the Firefox web browser. You will use the browser to view the

sample.html
 file as a rendered web page and as source text.


a. 
To view the file as a rendered web page, select 
File
 > 
Open
 
file
 in the
browser and navigate to the file 
sample.html
 that you just unzipped.


b. 
To view the file’s source code, select 
Tools
 > 
Web developer
 > 
View
source
.   

Describe the relationship and difference between the rendered page and the
source.


5. 
In this step, you will change the file and view the new version through the

browser.
a. 
Open a text editor (Notepad++ or TextWrangler). In the text editor, select
File
 > 
Open file
 and navigate to the file 
sample.html
 that you just

unzipped.

b. 
Change the “Supercool” and “Surprise” to anything you and your partner
want. Save your new version of the file.



c. 
In the browser, use the refresh button shown below to render the new
version of the file.





6. 
Add an image element to the HTML by adding a single tag as shown below. Save
the change to the HTML file and reload the page in your browser.

The 
src
 attribute provides the image file’s name. The value of the 
src
 attribute
can be a full URL. The value of 
src
 can be just the file name part of the URL if
the file is on the same 
filesystem
 as the HTML file.

The example here will render the 
sulfur.JPG
 image, which was provided in the
source files for the activity. The image file must be in the same folder as the
HTML to be rendered. Render a web page with the sulfur butterfly image or with
an image of your own.


 
<img src
="sulfur.JPG">



7. 
Another language used to create web pages is 
CSS
 (cascading style sheets.)
Styles affect the layout and appearance of a web page. CSS is usually written in a
separate file that can be applied to many pages on a web site to give the pages a
similar appearance. CSS can also be embedded in the document or applied

within a single HTML element. In the file 
sample.html
, embedded within an
HTML 
<style>
 element, is the following CSS:


 
h1 {

    
color: #
ff
00
ff
;

    
background
-
color: #ffffff;

}



a. 
This CSS specifies the text color and the background color for the 
h1

element’s text. What is the color 
#ff00ff
 of the text? Explain why this is

the color encoded by this hexadecimal string.

b. 
The last two digits 
ff
 
in the color string represent the blue intensity.
Inside the computer, how is this hexadecimal 
ff
 represented in binary?
Write the number for the blue intensity in zeros and ones.

c. 
Change the CSS for the style of 
h1
 elements so that they appear as yellow
text on a gray background. Note that gray is halfway between white and
black, with red, green, and blue components each halfway on.

8. 
Experiment with HTML elements and CSS properties to add to your page.
Browse online documentation and resources about HTML and CSS. Identify one
HTML element that is new to you and add it to your HTML. Find one new CSS
property for any element and set it in the HTML’s 
<style>
 element. Turn in
your result as directed by your teacher.
